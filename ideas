- place buildings
- td style
- harvesting resources
- city builder
- explore the world
- autopsy, biological stuff
- research plants
- you grow organically
- do stuff and stuff happens
- simulator style
- not survival we know that
- not shooter
- maybe projectiles are fun though
- farming
- story
- secrets
- puzzles
- should movement be fully free or limited
- sure I made a highlight system but free movement seems good
- move away from turn-based
- but don't lose that sense of taking as much time as you need
- so maybe like turns happen every time you move
- tick update style game world
- it might be cool if every move is a certain amount of time
- like the cost can be time instead of movement cost
- going from one tile to another progresses world time
- maybe day/night cycle for example
- that's cool actually
- but then like, how much time should each movement take
- should different actions take different amounts of time
- this is an interesting thought
- it'd be cool if you could also choose to wait on a tile
- like you don't have to move for time to pass
- imagine you plant a seed
- it can grow as you wait
- or as you explore the world
- and maybe spoil
- but spoil feels bad
- it feels like a chore
- so probably not spoiling food
- maybe just harvest when you're ready
- emphasise QoL and fun experience over realism bullshit
